In this article we will explain how to map the data between integration components to keep them in sync.

An integration flow on {{site.data.tenant.name}} platform must have at least two components, one trigger and one action. Trigger emits a data for the action component to receive and process it. Between these two components seats the {{site.data.tenant.name}} **data mapper**, which maps or matches the incoming data to the specific fields where the next component expects them to receive.


## Mapping simple values

Let us consider a simple scenario when we have an incoming data through the *Webhook* component like the following `JSON` structure.

```js
{
  "name": "Gromit",
  "status": "sold"
}
```

We intend to map these values into outgoing fields in *Petstore API* component. Let us jump into the integration flow design right at the mapping stage.

The screenshot above shows the stage in integration flow designer where the actual mapping or matching of the values is done. The *Petstore API* operation for creating a Pet requires a name and a status for the new pet. That's why the component asks the user to provide input in two fields: `Name` and `Status`. These two fields are required (red exclamation marks), which means without providing the values for them we won't be able to proceed further and click on *Continue* button. Let us proceed with the mapping.

To map the *Name* field click on a drop-down menu on the right side and select the matching value from the provided values in the *Data* tab. For example, our incoming data has a field `name` which we match with the *Name* field from *Petstore API* component.

![Mapping result of the field](/assets/img/integrator-guide/data-mapper/mapper-03.png "Mapping result of the field")

The screenshot above shows the successful mapping result which is `Gromit`. Notice that you have jumped to the *Mapping results* tab here which shows the successful evaluation result. Note also the green check-mark appeared besides the mapping field. This means the mapping of this field is valid.

![Expressions tab](/assets/img/integrator-guide/data-mapper/mapper-04.png "Expressions tab")

Before going further we can check the *Expressions* tab here. Here you can look under the hood of the [JSONata](http://jsonata.org/) powered mapper and see the list of expression and functions that is possible to use. We have already used them in the [how to create your first integration flow](/getting-started/first-flow) tutorial.

We can match the *Status* field with the incoming `status` value as well to complete the mapping and go forward.

> **Note** During the mapping process the mapping expressions is evaluated on the samples. During the component execution {{site.data.tenant.name}} evaluates these expressions based on the incoming data which will differ from the presented sample.

## Using advanced mapping mode

In the previous section you learned how to map data between two steps of an integration flow using a JSONata expression. This is a convenient approach, however, the graphical mapping in the *Integrator mode* has certain limitations. For example, the array-to-array mapping is only possible in the *Developer mode*. For that purpose we recommend switching to the *Developer mode* to continue.

> **Note** Array-to-array mappings is only possible in the *Developer mode*.

The following screenshot demonstrates the *Developer mode*.

![Developer mode](/assets/img/integrator-guide/data-mapper/mapper-05.png "Developer mode")

In the *Developer mode* you can write a single JSONata expressions for the entire input object instead of defining expressions for each individual field as in case of the *Integrator mode*.

To use the *Developer mode*, you need to know the meta-model of input data: the structure of the object and the property names. Without having access to component's source code knowing the input model is impossible.

Therefore, when you switch from *Integrator mode* to *Developer mode*, the mapper input field is pre-populated with a required JSON expression. {{site.data.tenant.name}} generates it from the incoming meta-model parameter values and random property values. You can write your mapping by overriding the property values.

![Developer mode edited values](/assets/img/integrator-guide/data-mapper/mapper-06.png "Developer mode edited values")

The above screenshot shows how the property values is replaced by the variables `name` and `status`. These variables get their values from the incoming payload of the Webhook component.

> **Please note** your expression is evaluated as you are typing it. The result is shown at once below the mapper input field, in the *Mapping result* section. If you give an invalid expression, an error message is displayed.

![Error in mapping](/assets/img/integrator-guide/data-mapper/mapper-07.png "Error in mapping")

The screenshot above shows the incomplete `JSON` structure which is not accepted by {{site.data.tenant.name}} and the error is shown in the *Mapping result* section.

> **Note** You can switch between *Developer* and *Integrator* modes during the design of integration flow but not after the flow is published. To change the mapping mode a new [draft version of a flow](managing-flow-history) must be created.
